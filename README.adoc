Benchmarks to compare various ways of selecting strings from a set.

The elementary ways are testing if a string has a particular prefix, and testing if it is in a particular set.

The alternatives use regular expressions to make the same tests. Regular expressions turn out to be quite a bit slower, and their speed depends heavily on some trivial detail of the expression!

To run the benchmarks, do:

....
./gradlew --no-daemon clean jmh
....

The first run will take a while because it will download the universe. After that should be reasonably quick.

Disable the daemon because it caches some wrong stuff and breaks if you change the benchmark code.

One run of the benchmarks gave results like this:
